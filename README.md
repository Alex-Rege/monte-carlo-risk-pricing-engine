# Monte Carlo Risk & Option Pricing Toolkit

A compact but professional quantitative finance toolkit showcasing:

- Simulation of asset prices under **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**
- **Monte Carlo** pricing of European call/put options
- Validation against **Black–Scholes** closed-form solutions
- **Confidence intervals** and convergence analysis for Monte Carlo estimates
- **Correlated multi-asset** GBM simulation using Cholesky decomposition
- Portfolio **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **CVaR** estimation

This project is designed to demonstrate core quantitative modelling skills relevant to
pricing, risk, and model validation roles in banks, hedge funds, and asset managers.
